### What I learned

As it turns out, stuff like this that wants me to position elements in an unorthodox manner (a plus shape rather than a straight line or something) is something I still have trouble with. It took me some time yet to work out I needed to put an extra div around two particular elements to get it to go + shaped rather than just be a straight line.

## Acknowledgments

I want to give a special thanks to my favorite coding youtubers: Coder Coder (AKA Jessica Chan), Code Creative and SelfTaughtDev for their amazing tutorials. While they don't do walkthroughs on this particular project, the concepts they cover in their videos played a big part in inspiring me to keep pushing forward and reach this point as a developer.
